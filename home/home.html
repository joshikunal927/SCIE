            conducting Sections A & B Examinations popularly known as AMIE,
            successful completion of which is recognized as equivalent to a
            degree in engineering by the Government of India, the Union Public

          <h2>HISTORY</h2>
          <p>
            Genesis: After First World war, the Industrialization were on rise
            and the engineering activity took a positive shape in India. As a
            consequence, need was felt to uphold the quality in products and
            operations of the Engineering domain. Accordingly Government of
            India formed an Indian Industrial Commission under the Chairmanship
            Sir Thomas Holland, the then Commerce member of the then Govt. of
            India. The commission recommended the establishment of an
            Institution as a professional body of engineers to ensure
            advancement of technology and uphold the quality of products in
            various stages of production. <br />On the basis of the
            recommendation several meetings of the leading engineers were held
            in various parts of country and “Indian Society of Engineers” was
            formed in 03 Jan 1919 at Calcutta. Subsequently, rules and
            constitution were drafted and circulated nationwide for the all
            interested people. Finally, with gained momentum of the efforts
            undertaken, a meeting was held in 16 Jul 1919 at Shimla to consider
            all modification and additions and the name of the Society was
            changed to The Institution of Engineers (India).
